                        <h3>Antecedents</h3>
                        <p>Many stories from antiquity involve flight, such as the Greek legend of Icarus and Daedalus,
                            and the
                            Vimana in ancient Indian epics. Around 400 BC in Greece, Archytas was reputed to have
                            designed and
                            built the first artificial, self-propelled flying device, a bird-shaped model propelled by a
                            jet of
                            what was probably steam, said to have flown some 200 m (660 ft). This machine may
                            have been
                            suspended for its flight.
                        </p>

                        <p>Some of the earliest recorded attempts with gliders were those by the 9th-century poet Abbas
                            ibn
                            Firnas and the 11th-century monk Eilmer of Malmesbury; both experiments injured their
                            pilots.
                            Leonardo da Vinci researched the wing design of birds and designed a man-powered aircraft in
                            his Codex on the Flight of Birds (1502).
                        </p>
                        <p>In 1799, George Cayley set forth the concept of the modern airplane as a fixed-wing flying
                            machine
                            with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control. Cayley was building and
                            flying
                            models of fixed-wing aircraft as early as 1803, and he built a successful passenger-carrying
                            glider
                            in 1853. In 1856, Frenchman Jean-Marie Le Bris made the first powered flight, by having
                            his
                            glider "L'Albatros artificiel" pulled by a horse on a beach. Then Alexander F. Mozhaisky
                            also
                            made some innovative designs. In 1883, the American John J. Montgomery made a controlled
                            flight in a
                            glider. Other aviators who made similar flights at that time were Otto Lilienthal, Percy
                            Pilcher, and Octave Chanute.

                        <p>Sir Hiram Maxim built a craft that weighed 3.5 tons, with a 110-foot (34 m) wingspan that
                            was
                            powered by two 360-horsepower (270 kW) steam engines driving two propellers. In 1894, his
                            machine
                            was tested with overhead rails to prevent it from rising. The test showed that it had enough
                            lift to
                            take off. The craft was uncontrollable, which Maxim, it is presumed, realized, because he
                            subsequently abandoned work on it.

                        <p>In the 1890s, Lawrence Hargrave conducted research on wing structures and developed a box
                            kite that
                            lifted the weight of a man. His box kite designs were widely adopted. Although he also
                            developed a
                            type of rotary aircraft engine, he did not create and fly a powered fixed-wing aircraft.

                            Between 1867 and 1896, the German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal developed
                            heavier-than-air flight. He was the first person to make well-documented, repeated,
                            successful
                            gliding flights.

                        <p>Patent drawings of Clement Ader's Éole.
                            Clement Ader constructed his first of three flying machines in 1886, the Éole. It
                            was a bat-like
                            design run by a lightweight steam engine of his own invention, with four cylinders
                            developing 20
                            horsepower (15 kW), driving a four-blade propeller. The engine weighed no more than
                            4 kilograms per
                            kilowatt (6.6 lb/hp). The wings had a span of 14 m (46 ft). All-up weight was 300
                            kilograms (660
                            lb). On 9 October 1890, Ader attempted to fly the Éole. Aviation historians give
                            credit to this
                            effort as a powered take-off and uncontrolled hop of approximately 50 m (160 ft) at
                            a height of
                            approximately 20 centimetres (7.9 in). Ader's two subsequent machines were
                            not documented to
                            have achieved flight.

                        <p>The Wright brothers flights in 1903 are recognized by the Fédération Aéronautique
                            Internationale
                            (FAI), the standard setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics, as "the first
                            sustained and
                            controlled heavier-than-air powered flight". By 1905, the Wright Flyer III was
                            capable of fully
                            controllable, stable flight for substantial periods. The Wright brothers credited
                            Otto Lilienthal as
                            a major inspiration for their decision to pursue manned flight.

                        <p>Santos-Dumont 14-bis, between 1906 and 1907
                            In 1906, Alberto Santos-Dumont made what was claimed to be the first airplane flight
                            unassisted by
                            catapult and set the first world record recognized by the Aéro-Club de France by
                            flying 220
                            meters (720 ft) in less than 22 seconds. This flight was also certified by the
                            FAI.

                        <p>An early aircraft design that brought together the modern monoplane tractor
                            configuration was the
                            Blériot VIII design of 1908. It had movable tail surfaces controlling both yaw and
                            pitch, a form of
                            roll control supplied either by wing warping or by ailerons and controlled by its
                            pilot with a
                            joystick and rudder bar. It was an important predecessor of his later Blériot XI
                            Channel-crossing
                            aircraft of the summer of 1909.

                        <p>World War I served as a testbed for the use of the airplane as a weapon. Airplanes
                            demonstrated
                            their potential as mobile observation platforms, then proved themselves to be
                            machines of war
                            capable of causing casualties to the enemy. The earliest known aerial victory with a
                            synchronized
                            machine gun-armed fighter aircraft occurred in 1915, by German Luftstreitkräfte
                            Leutnant Kurt
                            Wintgens. Fighter aces appeared; the greatest (by number of Aerial Combat victories)
                            was Manfred von
                            Richthofen.
                        </p>
                        <p>Following WWI, aircraft technology continued to develop. Alcock and Brown crossed
                            the Atlantic
                            non-stop for the first time in 1919. The first international commercial flights took
                            place between
                            the United States and Canada in 1919.
                        </p>
                        <p>Airplanes had a presence in all the major battles of World War II. They were an
                            essential component
                            of the military strategies of the period, such as the German Blitzkrieg, The Battle
                            of Britain, and
                            the American and Japanese aircraft carrier campaigns of the Pacific War.

                        <h3>Development of jet aircraft</h3>
                        <p>The first practical jet aircraft was the German Heinkel He 178, which was tested in
                            1939. In 1943,
                            the Messerschmitt Me 262, the first operational jet fighter aircraft, went into
                            service in the
                            German Luftwaffe. In October 1947, the Bell X-1 was the first aircraft to exceed the
                            speed of
                            sound.
                        </p>
                        <p>The first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet, was introduced in 1952. The Boeing
                            707, the first
                            widely successful commercial jet, was in commercial service for more than 50 years,
                            from 1958 to
                            2010. The Boeing 747 was the world's biggest passenger aircraft from 1970 until it
                            was surpassed by
                            the Airbus A380 in 2005.
