                        <p>An aircraft propeller, or airscrew, converts rotary motion from an engine or other power
                            source,
                            into a swirling slipstream which pushes the propeller forwards or backwards. It comprises a
                            rotating power-driven hub, to which are attached several radial airfoil-section blades such
                            that
                            the whole assembly rotates about a longitudinal axis. Three types of aviation engines used
                            to power propellors include reciprocating engines (or piston engines), gas turbine engines,
                            and
                            electric motors. The amount of thrust a propeller creates is determined by its disk area—the
                            area in which the blades rotate. If the area is too small, efficiency is poor, and if the
                            area
                            is large, the propeller must rotate at a very low speed to avoid going supersonic and
                            creating a
                            lot of noise, and not much thrust. Because of this limitation, propellers are favored for
                            planes
                            that travel at below Mach 0.6, while jets are a better choice above that speed. Propeller
                            engines may be quieter than jet engines (though not always) and may cost less to purchase or
                            maintain and so remain common on light general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna 172.
                            Larger
                            modern propeller planes, such as the Dash 8, use a jet engine to turn the propeller,
                            primarily
                            because an equivalent piston engine in power output would be much larger and more complex.

                        <p>Reciprocating engines in aircraft have three main variants, radial, in-line and flat or
                            horizontally opposed engine. The radial engine is a reciprocating type internal combustion
                            engine configuration in which the cylinders "radiate" outward from a central crankcase like
                            the
                            spokes of a wheel and was commonly used for aircraft engines before gas turbine engines
                            became
                            predominant. An inline engine is a reciprocating engine with banks of cylinders, one behind
                            another, rather than rows of cylinders, with each bank having any number of cylinders, but
                            rarely more than six, and may be water-cooled. A flat engine is an internal combustion
                            engine
                            with horizontally-opposed cylinders.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Gas turbine</h3>
                        <p>A turboprop gas turbine engine consists of an intake, compressor, combustor, turbine, and a
                            propelling nozzle, which provide power from a shaft through a reduction gearing to the
                            propeller. The propelling nozzle provides a relatively small proportion of the thrust
                            generated
                            by a turboprop.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Electric motor</h3>
                        <p>An electric aircraft runs on electric motors rather than internal combustion engines, with
                            electricity coming from fuel cells, solar cells, ultracapacitors, power beaming, or
                            batteries. Currently, flying electric aircraft are mostly experimental prototypes, including
                            manned and unmanned aerial vehicles, but there are some production models on the market
                            already.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Jet</h2>
                        <p>Jet aircraft are propelled by jet engines, which are used because the aerodynamic limitations
                            of
                            propellers do not apply to jet propulsion. These engines are much more powerful than a
                            reciprocating engine for a given size or weight and are comparatively quiet and work well at
                            higher altitude. Variants of the jet engine include the ramjet and the scramjet, which rely
                            on
                            high airspeed and intake geometry to compress the combustion air, prior to the introduction
                            and
                            ignition of fuel. Rocket motors provide thrust by burning a fuel with an oxidizer and
                            expelling
                            gas through a nozzle.
                        </p>

                            <div class="image_caption">
                                Turbofan engine
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>Most modern jet planes use turbofan jet engines, which balance the advantages of a propeller
                            while retaining the exhaust speed and power of a jet. This is essentially a ducted propeller
                            attached to a jet engine, much like a turboprop, but with a smaller diameter. When installed
                            on
                            an airliner, it is efficient so long as it remains below the speed of sound (or subsonic).
                            Jet
                            fighters and other supersonic aircraft that do not spend a great deal of time supersonic
                            also
                            often use turbofans, but to function, air intake ducting is needed to slow the air down so
                            that
                            when it arrives at the front of the turbofan, it is subsonic. When passing through the
                            engine,
                            it is then re-accelerated back to supersonic speeds. To further boost the power output, fuel
                            is
                            dumped into the exhaust stream, where it ignites. This is called an afterburner and has been
                            used on both pure jet aircraft and turbojet aircraft although it is only normally used on
                            combat
                            aircraft due to the amount of fuel consumed, and even then may only be used for short
                            periods of
                            time. Supersonic airliners (e.g. Concorde) are no longer in use largely because flight at
                            supersonic speed creates a sonic boom, which is prohibited in most heavily populated areas,
                            and
                            because of the much higher consumption of fuel supersonic flight requires.
                        </p>
                        <p>Jet aircraft possess high cruising speeds (700 to 900 km/h (430 to 560 mph)) and high speeds
                            for
                            takeoff and landing (150 to 250 km/h (93 to 155 mph)). Due to the speed needed for takeoff
                            and
                            landing, jet aircraft use flaps and leading edge devices to control the lift and speed. Many
                            jet
                            aircraft also use thrust reversers to slow down the aircraft upon landing.

                        <h3>Ramjet</h3>
                        <p>A ramjet is a form of jet engine that contains no major moving parts and can be particularly
                            useful in applications requiring a small and simple engine for high-speed use, such as with
                            missiles. Ramjets require forward motion before they can generate thrust and so are often
                            used
                            in conjunction with other forms of propulsion, or with an external means of achieving
                            sufficient
                            speed. The Lockheed D-21 was a Mach 3+ ramjet-powered reconnaissance drone that was launched
                            from a parent aircraft. A ramjet uses the vehicle's forward motion to force air through the
                            engine without resorting to turbines or vanes. Fuel is added and ignited, which heats and
                            expands the air to provide thrust.

                        </div>
                        <p>A scramjet is a supersonic ramjet and aside from differences with dealing with internal
                            supersonic airflow works like a conventional ramjet. This type of engine requires a very
                            high
                            initial speed in order to work. The NASA X-43, an experimental unmanned scramjet, set a
                            world
                            speed record in 2004 for a jet-powered aircraft with a speed of Mach 9.7, nearly 7,500 miles
                            per
                            hour (12,100 km/h).

                        <h3>Rocket</h3>
                        <p>In World War II, the Germans deployed the Me 163 Komet rocket-powered aircraft. The first
                            plane
                            to break the sound barrier in level flight was a rocket plane – the Bell X-1. The later
                            North
                            American X-15 broke many speed and altitude records and laid much of the groundwork for
                            later
                            aircraft and spacecraft design. Rocket aircraft are not in common usage today, although
                            rocket-assisted take offs are used for some military aircraft. Recent rocket aircraft
                            include
                            the SpaceShipOne and the XCOR EZ-Rocket.
                        <p>There are many rocket-powered aircraft/spacecraft planes, the spaceplanes, that are designed
                            to
                            fly outside Earth's atmosphere.
